    <h2>Day 1 - February 16, 2024</h2>
    <p>
        The alarm rang at 7 am, reluctantly got out of bed and went to school. Endured a day of dull lectures and
        assignments. After school, there wasn't much excitement—just came home, watched a show on TV, and had a
        microwave dinner. Went to bed early, hoping for a more exciting day tomorrow.

    <h2>Day 2 - February 17, 2024</h2>
    <p>
        Another uneventful day at school. Took notes, answered questions, and waited for the clock to strike 3 pm.
        After school, the routine continued—watching TV shows until it was time for bed. Ate a simple dinner, nothing
        noteworthy. Hoping for a change in the routine soon.

    <h2>Day 3 - February 18, 2024</h2>
    <p>
        Weekend is here, but nothing special planned. Woke up late, had a simple breakfast, and spent the day binge-watching
        shows. Ate leftovers for dinner and continued the TV marathon until bedtime. The weekend felt like an extension
        of the week—uneventful and mundane.
